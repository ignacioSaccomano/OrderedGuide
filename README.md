# OrderMath

## What is this about?
Ok. So you were given a guide of exercises or activities to do and some will be chosen, at random, to correct. Now, you start working and skipping activities here and there till you realise how hard it will be to verify which ones are missing. Now we have a problem. You have to write down each exercise you did, one by one no matter the order, to view them ordered and check how many and which ones are missing.

## Just that?
Esentially yes. Or not (music from [vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce)). The more i did, the more i wanted. So aditionally, after knowing the order and the missing exercises, you can specify how many you have to hand in so that the program tells you how likely it is for you to be asked for an exercise you havenÂ´t done.

## Project conclusion
This is intended for any student, lazy ones specially. Not only because of its efficiency but specially for the part of calculating the odds of you being "busted", sort of speak. We were all there. At the moment i am in that sort of situation, and i thought someone had to do it.

## Future
Not planning anything interesting rn. Maybe will optimize it a little.
